# `Elm Debug.log parser` [![Build Status](https://github.com/kraklin/elm-debug-parser/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kraklin/elm-debug-parser/actions?query=branch%3Amain)
Parser for tokenizing Debug.log messages, written in Elm.

- [ ] Replace this with a nice readme (see this guide for designing Elm packages and writing nice docs/READMEs: <https://github.com/dillonkearns/idiomatic-elm-package-guide>)
- [ ] Find all instances of replaceme in this repo and replace them
- [ ] Add a file called `LICENSE` to the top-level folder. This is required to publish an Elm package. The most common and recommended license for open source Elm packages is BSD-3.
- [ ] Publish version 1.0.0 (you have to start at V1 with Elm packages). Run `elm publish` from the root folder of this repo when you're all ready, and it will walk you through the process!
